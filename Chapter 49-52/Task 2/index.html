  <h1>ITEM DETAILS</h1>
  <p id="para">Each item in ArcGIS Online includes an item page with a variety of information, actions, options, and settings organized by tab: Overview, Data, Visualization, Usage, and Settings. The tabs you see, as well as the options and information available on the tabs, depends on the item type, your privileges, and whether you are the item owner or administrator.
  <br>
    Item pages allow you to explore items in-depth in a variety of ways. For example, an interactive attribute table integrates related records and attachments, allowing you to navigate attribute data and view all aspects of a field together, including field values, summary statistics, and settings. Content creators and administrators can change an item's settings without having to go to other places on the site. For example, you can configure an app from a scene on the Overview tab or edit app settings directly on the Settings tab. Feature layer styles, pop-ups, and other layer properties can be configured on the Visualization tab as an alternative to opening the layer in Map Viewer.</p>
